Created a basic recipe website using allrecipes.com and images found via google. Great way to learn how to use basic skills like, ul, ol, a href, img src etc. 

Also gave me a chance to get a bit more comfortable with git. Still not sure how to do my comments yet, but I'm sure i'll get better over time.
